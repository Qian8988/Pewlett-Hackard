Export the Mentorship Eligibility table as mentorship_eligibilty.csv 
[mentorship_eligibility.csv]( Deliverable2/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

### Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

### Purpose of our project

The purpose of our project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

### The Results


• From the retirment_titles table we can see the employees who are eligible for retirement.

•	The retiring_titles tables shows the number and titles of the employees who will be retiring.

### Summary
 
•29,414 Senior Engineer's, 28,255 Senior Staff, 14,222 Engineer's, 12,242 Staff, 4,502 Technique Leader's, 1,761 Assistant Engineer's and 2 Manager's roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. 

•The number of employees who are qualify for the mentorship program is 1,549. Those employees need to train 90,398 new employees, which might be a hard mission to be completed. Pewlett-Hackard might need more eligible mentors to train new employees.
